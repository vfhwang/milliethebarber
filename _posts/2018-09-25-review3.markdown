Been going to Millie the barber for many years and she never fails to deliver an amazing cut, served up with a dose of straight talking styling advice and a bit of Irish craic.

She completely changed my hair style for my wedding and I'm so glad I listened to her advice. She's 100% worth travelling to see as I know many of her clients do. Top notch service, book an appointment, you won't regret it!
